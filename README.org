Supervised, interactive genomic data analysis

This slide deck is a summary of my contributions to supervised and
interactive data analysis in the past few years (2011-2014).

The most interesting parts are the xypics that clearly show the
differences between supervised (plot before modeling) and unsupervised
analysis (plot after modeling).

The other main contribution is the 2 x 2 table that classifies
the types of analysis methods:

| Evaluation:         | qualitative  | quantitative |
| Input: data $x$ +   | parameters   | labels $y$   |
|                     |              |              |
|                     | unsupervised | supervised   |
|---------------------+--------------+--------------|
| non-interactive     |              |              |
| (fit one model)     |              |              |
|---------------------+--------------+--------------|
| interactive         |              |              |
| (plot/update model) |              |              |
|---------------------+--------------+--------------|
